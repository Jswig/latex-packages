# LaTex packages

LaTeX packages for things I frequently write. Tested under TexLive 2019 for Windows.


- `mathpb.sty`: preamble for math problem sets and reports with macros for frequent symbols.
Custom environments adapted from [Dana C. Ersnt](https://gist.github.com/dcernst/1827406). 
  - package name: `mathpb`
  - use examples: [mathpb_example.pdf](https://github.com/Jswig/latex-packages/blob/master/mathpb_example.pdf)

## Usage

Make sure that the package/class you want to use is in the same directory as your main `.tex` document.

### .sty files

```tex
\usepackage{packagename}
```
