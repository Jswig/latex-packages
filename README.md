# LaTex packages

LaTex packages and classes I wrote for frequent use cases. Tested under TexLive 2019 for Windows.


- `mathpb.sty`: preamble for math problem sets and reports. Custom environments adapted from [Dana C. Ersnt](https://gist.github.com/dcernst/1827406). package name: `mathpb`
- `res.cls` class for writing resumes, adapted  Michael DeCorte

## Usage

### .sty files

```tex
\usepackage{packagename}
```

### .cls files

```tex
\documentclass{classname}
```
